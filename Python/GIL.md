# GIL

Global Interpreter Lock

### Why GIL?

> Python uses reference counting for memory management. It means that objects created in Python have a reference count variable that keeps track of the number of references that point to the object. When this count reaches zero, the memory occupied by the object is released.  
> ...  
> The problem was that this reference count variable needed protection from race conditions where two threads increase or decrease its value simultaneously.  
> ...  
> The GIL is a single lock on the interpreter itself which adds a rule that execution of any Python bytecode requires acquiring the interpreter lock. This prevents deadlocks (as there is only one lock) and doesnâ€™t introduce much performance overhead. But it effectively makes any CPU-bound Python program single-threaded.  

### The impact on multi-threaded Python programs

> In the multi-threaded version the GIL prevented the CPU-bound threads from executing in parellel.  
> The GIL does not have much impact on the performance of I/O-bound multi-threaded programs as the lock is shared between threads while they are waiting for I/O.
